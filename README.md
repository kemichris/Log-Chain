# Log Chain

This project harnesses blockchain technology to develop a transparent and secure user sign-in tracking system for companies. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain, our solution provides a tamper-proof record of user activity, ensuring accountability and trust.


## Motivation

With the increasing unreliability of web2 data, this project will help company  utilize blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent logbook that tracks user sign-ins. This innovative approach ensures the authenticity and integrity of user data, providing a tamper-proof record that fosters trust and accountability. By leveraging blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature, we can guarantee that user activity is accurately recorded and accessible, without any risk of compromise or manipulation.
